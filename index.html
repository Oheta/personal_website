			<h3>Hello there!</h3><span>I'm delighted that you've found your way to my corner of the internet. Allow me to introduce myself and give you a glimpse into my world of engineering, development, and a few other passions that fuel my life.</span>
			<p>My journey into the world of technology and engineering began after high school when I embarked on an intense two-year educational journey known as CPGE (Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles). This rigorous program laid the foundation for my pursuit of engineering excellence. In 2020, I proudly earned my diploma from EFREI Paris Engineering School, specializing in the fascinating realms of image processing and virtual reality.</p>
			<p>I'm a software engineer by trade, but my experiences have taken me on a remarkable adventure through the diverse landscapes of technology. During my time at EFREI Paris, I had the privilege of undertaking two internships with Thales Group, where I delved into the intricate world of embedded software. These invaluable experiences broadened my horizons and sharpened my skills.</p>
			<p>My passion for innovation and creativity led me to my final internship at Aubay, where I embraced the role of a research and development engineer. Here, I was fortunate to contribute to a cutting-edge virtual reality project, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the digital realm.</p>
			<p>Upon earning my degree from EFREI Paris, I embarked on a two-year journey as a consultant with SII Group, where I specialized in embedded systems engineering for defense projects. This chapter of my career was both challenging and fulfilling, as I worked on projects that had stark requirements on both the security and reliability of their products. I also lived up to important confidentiality requirements from my clients.</p>
			<p>Now, as of June 2023, I've embraced a new chapter in my professional life as a freelancer. This transition allows me to leverage my expertise and creativity to bring unique solutions to clients across various industries. I look forward to the exciting challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
			<p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I find joy and inspiration in a range of hobbies that enrich my life. First and foremost, I'm an avid cook, and I enjoy sharing the fruits of my passion with my coworkers. When I'm not in the kitchen, you might find me on the dance floor, grooving to the beats of pop rock music. I'm also a singer, with 11 years of experience in a baroque choir and even an artist page on Spotify where you can discover my musical endeavors.</p>
			<p>Exploring the depths of the ocean as a diver is another one of my cherished pastimes, where the beauty and serenity of the underwater world never cease to amaze me. In my downtime, I enjoy immersing myself in management simulations and grand strategy video games, fostering my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>
			<p>During my time at EFREI Paris, I didn't just focus on academics. I was actively involved in multiple clubs and extracurricular activities that enriched my college experience. I was a proud member of the Cooking Club, where I shared my culinary passion and delighted in the joys of sharing with fellow students during school events. Additionally, I served as a teacher for rock dance and held the positions of secretary and vice-president at the Dancing Club, where I not only danced to my heart's content but also helped organize and manage club activities.</p>
			<p>My involvement extended beyond the dance floor, as I also served as secretary and vice-president at the International Relationships Club, fostering connections and cultural exchanges with students from around the world. Music holds a special place in my heart, and I expressed my passion by being a dedicated singer in the Music Club, where I had the privilege of performing in two concerts with a student rock band.</p>
			<p>One of my most memorable and challenging experiences was being a part of the Integration Weekend Club, where we undertook the monumental task of organizing an event for 800 students over an entire weekend. This endeavor tested my organizational and communication skills, and it was incredibly rewarding to see the successful outcome of our hard work.</p>
			<p>As you browse through my website, I invite you to explore the various facets of my professional journey, from engineering and development to the projects I've been fortunate to be a part of. I also encourage you to delve into the stories behind my hobbies, which not only provide balance to my life but also offer unique insights into my personality and creativity.</p>
			<p>Thank you for visiting my corner of the web, and I hope you find inspiration and insight within these web pages. Whether you're here for professional collaboration, seeking innovative solutions, or simply looking for a fellow enthusiast in cooking, music, or gaming, I'm excited to connect with you and embark on new adventures together. Welcome to my world of innovation and exploration!</p>
